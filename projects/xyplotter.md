# XY Plotter

![XY Plotter Render](/images/xyplotter.png)

This project was started in 2021. The aim of the XY-Plotter project is to design a sketching machine that will be constructed of rails and 3D-printed components that are modelled using CAD software.

The project involves creating a custom G-Code converter, allowing users to create drawings from uploaded images or drawings.

XY-Plotter is well-suited to beginners looking to develop fundamental skills in programming, electronics, and mechanical design.
