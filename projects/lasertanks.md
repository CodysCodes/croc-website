# Laser Tanks

![Laser Tank Render](/images/lasertank.png)

The Laser Tanks project started in 2016, and aims to create a competitive game of laser tag, played by four remote controlled miniature tanks, in a Mario Kart-esque arena. Over the years, there have been multiple design iterations, most notably in the design of the tanks themselves.

The project is made out of entirely custom parts, with the tanks being modelled in CAD, before being 3D printed and fitted with custom
PCBs. The tanks traverse the arena, picking up power-ups such as speed or range boosts,
and attempting to fire upon other tanks in the arena.

Laser Tanks focuses largely on developing skills in programming, networking, electronics, and mechanical design. The project requires fundamental knowledge in one or more of the listed areas, though allows for upskilling whilst involved.
