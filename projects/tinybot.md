# TinyBot

![Picture of Tinybot](/images/tinybot.jpg)

TinyBot is a small robot designed and launched in 2021 by our 2021 and 2022 Project Admin. The robot can be built by a single person, and is designed with simplicity in mind, which means that it can be built in merely a few hours. This project provides all necessary materials and components, as well as highly informative instructions on assembly and basic coding.

The project is aimed at introducing new members to the fundamentals of robotics. Sponsoring TinyBot allows the Club to buy the materials to build more TinyBot kits.
