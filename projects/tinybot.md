TinyBot is a small robot designed and launched in 2021 by our 2021 and 2022 Project Admin. The robot can be built by a single person, and is designed with simplicity in mind, which means that it can be built in merely a few hours. This project provides all necessary materials and components, as well as highly informative instructions on assembly and basic coding.
