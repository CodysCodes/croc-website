Started in 2016, BoozeBot has undergone 3 progressive version changes. BoozeBot is an automated drink serving robot intended to mix andserve a variety of drinks.

BoozeBot is intended for use as catering at events, or small scale commercial use. Previous versions of BoozeBot were a great success at events, and it’s publicity makes it one of the Club’s most popular externally-facing projects.

The project uses a number of high accuracy pumps, a pressurised system and a linear rail, combined with a detailed front and backend codebase to accurately serve drinks. We hope to make successive improvements on BoozeBot for years to come.
