# Winston the UR5

Winston the UR5 Arm was donated to the club by Woodside Energy in 2022. The projectâ€™s team aims to design and build a gripper for the arm in order to carry out simple tasks, such as picking up and placing down objects.

This gripper will be designed from the ground up and led through all stages of design to final conception. Once the final concept has been determined, production of the gripper will commence with the final product to be fitted onto the UR5 arm.

This project provides members with the full experience of designing and manufacturing a product that must integrate with a pre-existing design. This project is suitable for beginners as it covers CAD design, mechanical construction, electrical design and integration, and manufacturing.
