# About Us

The Curtin Robotics Club (CRoC) is a knowledge-sharing club. 

Our club focuses on practical learning, giving members projects that assist in the broadening of knowledge, as well as consolidating theoretical information gained during their degrees. 

We run a variety of projects of differing difficulties. These projects each have a single project lead and a team working on them at all times. The projects are funded by the club, and require large amounts of committment from members in order to progress. To find out more about the projects, come chat to us in our club room (B215.105).

You can find us in person on the Curtin University Bently Campus in Building 215 room 105. Or feel free to contact us through one of our other channels:
